CRM - Customer Relationship Management

This is a databse web application with Spring MVC and Hibernate. This full CRUD application is a Customer Relationship Management
system that allows to track customers. We can add new customers, update, delete, and also list all the customers in our database.

This is one of the projects that I learned in a Udemy course:
